## Definition

**Topographic Database** (pl. *Baza Danych Obiektów Topograficznych*) is a vector (object) database containing the spatial location of topographic objects with their characteristics.
The content and detail of the database correspond to the topographic map in the scale 1:10000.
The thematic scope includes information on water network, communication network, land cover, buildings, technical structures, land use, protected areas, and territorial division units.
The database is available in the Geography Markup Language (GML) format.
The source of its data comes from:

- other spatial databases maintained by Polish Head Office of Geodesy and Cartography (e.g. *Register of Towns, Streets and Addresses*, *Register of Land and Buildings*, *State Register of Borders*),
- databases maintained by other ministries or institutions (e.g. Ministry of Infrastructure, State Water Management, General Directorate for Environmental Protection),
- fieldworks

## Purpose

The purpose of this vignette is to perform spatial operations on vector data from the Topographic Database.
We focus on four cases, taking point, line, and polygon data and their attributes into account.
In addition, we show how they can be visualized.

## Analysis

```{r message=FALSE}
# load packages
library(sf)
library(rgugik)
```

Our analysis area is the *bieszczadzki* county located in the Subcarpathian (*podkarpackie*) voivodeship.
It is the farthest area in the south of Poland and has the lowest population density (19 people on km^2^).

### Database

We start by downloading the topographic database for our county using the `topodb_download()` function.

```{r message=FALSE}
# 22.4 MB
topodb_download("bieszczadzki", outdir = "./data")
```

The downloaded database consists of many files in the *Geography Markup Language* format.
All the data necessary for analyzes can be found in `data/PL.PZGiK.332.1801/BDOT10K/` location.
A brief description of the structure of this database can be found [here](https://kadyb.github.io/rgugik/articles/articles/geodb_description.html).

First, let's load the file with administrative units (*PL.PZGiK.332.1801__OT_ADJA_A.xml*), using the **sf** package and its `read_sf()` function.

```{r}
territory = read_sf("data/PL.PZGiK.332.1801/BDOT10k/PL.PZGiK.332.1801__OT_ADJA_A.xml")
```

The file contains administrative units at various levels, let's choose the lowest level, i.e. communes.
There are three types of communes in this dataset: urban (*GM*), rural (*GW*), and urban-rural (*Gmw*).
Their type is specified in the `rodzaj` column.
Let's select them.

```{r}
communes = territory[territory$rodzaj %in% c("GM", "GW", "Gmw"), "rodzaj"]
table(communes$rodzaj)
```

We can see that the *bieszczadzki* county consists of two rural communes and one urban-rural commune.
Let's visualize it.

```{r communes}
plot(communes, axes = TRUE, main = "Bieszczadzki county")
```

### Lengths and categories of roads

In the first task, we calculate the lengths of roads taking into account their categories.
Road data can be found in the *PL.PZGiK.332.1801__OT_SKDR_L.xml* file.

```{r}
roads = read_sf("data/PL.PZGiK.332.1801/BDOT10k/PL.PZGiK.332.1801__OT_SKDR_L.xml")
```

Let's plot them.
<!--JN: maybe it would be good to add a sentence or two of explanation of the following code -->

```{r roads}
plot(roads["katZarzadzania"], main = "Road category", reset = FALSE)
plot(st_geometry(territory), add = TRUE)
```

We have six road categories related to the managing entity, those are: national (K), voivodeship (W), county (P), communal (G), institutional (Z) and other (I).

We use the `st_length()` function to find the length of each object in the table.
Next, we create a data frame consisting of the road category and its length.
Then we aggregate this data frame and calculate the sum of the lengths for each category.

```{r}
length_roads = st_length(roads)
length_roads = data.frame(length = length_roads,
                          class = as.factor(roads$katZarzadzania))
length_roads = aggregate(length ~ class, data = length_roads, FUN = sum)
```

The results are given in meters - let's convert them into kilometers.

```{r}
# convert to [km]
length_roads$length = units::set_units(length_roads$length, "km")
```

Let's also change the names of the categories.

```{r}
road_class = c("communal", "other", "national", "county", "voivodeship",
               "institutional")
levels(length_roads$class) = road_class
```

Now we can see the results.
The `other` type of roads dominates that consists mainly of non-public roads.

```{r}
length_roads
```

We can also calculate the total length of the roads in this area.

```{r}
sum(length_roads$length)
```

The result is about `r round(sum(length_roads$length), 3)` km.
Another aspect of the data that we can investigate is the density of the road network.
We need to calculate the total area first, and then divide the total road length by the total area.

```{r}
communes_area = sum(st_area(communes))
communes_area = units::set_units(communes_area, "km2")
density = sum(length_roads$length)/communes_area
density = units::set_units(density, "km/km2")
density
```

The road density is about `r round(density, 2)` km/km^2^.

### Roads through the rivers

Another dataset included in the Topographic Database contains rivers for this area (*PL.PZGiK.332.1801__OT_SWRS_L.xml*).

```{r}
rivers = read_sf("data/PL.PZGiK.332.1801/BDOT10k/PL.PZGiK.332.1801__OT_SWRS_L.xml")
rivers = rivers[rivers$rodzaj == "Rz", ] # select only rivers
```

Rivers are divided into smaller sections with different parameters (such as, river width or data source).
Let's merge the same rivers into single feature (geometry) - we can use the attribute with ID (`idMPHP`) for that purpose.
We can also give each river a category number by creating a sequence from 1 to n.

```{r}
rivers = aggregate(rivers[, c("geometry", "idMPHP")],
                   list(rivers$idMPHP),
                   sum)
rivers$idMPHP = seq_len(length(unique(rivers$idMPHP)))
rivers$idMPHP = as.factor(rivers$idMPHP)
```

Let's visualize the rivers' courses.

```{r rivers}
plot(rivers["idMPHP"], main = "Rivers", reset = FALSE)
plot(st_geometry(territory), add = TRUE)
```

With rivers and roads, we can designate points of intersection that symbolize bridges and crossings.
We can use the `st_intersection()` function for this.

```{r warning=FALSE}
bridges = st_geometry(st_intersection(rivers, roads))
length(bridges)
```

We get 81 such points.
Let's plot them.

```{r bridges}
plot(st_geometry(rivers), main = "Bridges and crossings", col = "blue")
plot(st_geometry(territory), add = TRUE)
plot(bridges, add = TRUE, pch = 21, cex = 2)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
rm(rivers)
rm(roads)
rm(bridges)
```

### Land cover

Let's check the land cover in our county - it is stored in files with the  `PT` prefix.
We use the `list.files()` function to list them.
The `pattern` argument is important here, because it determines what files should be selected.
Our `pattern` should look like this: `PT+.+A\\.xml$` - only files containing area (A) land cover (PT) will be listed.
<!--JN: what is "area land cover"??-->

```{r}
files = list.files("data/PL.PZGiK.332.1801/BDOT10k",
                   pattern = "PT+.+A\\.xml$",
                   full.names = TRUE)
files_name = basename(files)
files_name
```

Let's exclude *PL.PZGiK.332.1801__OT_PTSO_A.xml* file from list, because there are no objects.
<!--JN: what do you mean??-->

```{r}
# drop "OT_PTSO_A.xml"
files = files[-7]
files_name = files_name[-7]
```

Let's prepare the names of the objects to which the data will be loaded.
<!--JN: I do not understand what do you mean here-->
<!--JN: I understand the code, though.. Where did you get this names? Are they universal? This should be explained...-->

```{r}
layers = c("fallowlands", "communication", "forest", "undeveloped",
           "squares", "shrublands", "crops", "grassland",
           "water", "heaps", "buildings")
```

Now iteratively we will load each GML file, naming it from the list above.
<!--JN: I would suggest rewriting the code in this section. I have almost never seen the use of assign in the exploratory code...-->

```{r}
for (i in seq_len(length(files))) {
  assign(layers[i], read_sf(files[i]))
}
```

Previously, we used `st_length()` to calculate the line length, now we use corresponding `st_area()` function to calculate the area.
For each object (layer), we calculate its area separately in a loop.

```{r}
# initialize empty vector
area_landcover = integer()

for (i in seq_len(length(layers))) {
  area_tmp = st_area(eval(as.name(layers[i])))
  area_tmp = sum(area_tmp)

  # add result from the current iteration to the vector
  area_landcover = c(area_landcover, area_tmp)
}

# convert units
area_landcover = units::set_units(area_landcover, "m^2")
area_landcover = units::set_units(area_landcover, "km^2")
names(area_landcover) = layers
```

Let's see the results (in kilometers).

```{r}
area_landcover
```

Let's make sure that the total land cover is equal to the area of our county.
Some tiny precision differences are possible, so we should set the difference tolerance.
This is possible using the `all.equal()` function.

```{r}
all.equal(sum(area_landcover), communes_area, tolerance = 0.001)
```

Everything is correct.
Let's present the results as percentages of the area and sort them in the descending order.

```{r}
landcover_percentage = area_landcover/sum(area_landcover)*100
units(landcover_percentage) = NULL # drop units
landcover_percentage = round(landcover_percentage, 2)
landcover_percentage = sort(landcover_percentage, decreasing = TRUE)
landcover_percentage
```

Over 75% of the county's area is covered by forests and only less than 1% by buildings.

```{r include=FALSE}
layers = layers[-11] # keep "buildings"
rm(list = layers)
```

### Buffer

The last type of analysis in this vignette is uses spatial buffers.
We want to check how many buildings have access to bus stops within a given distance.
Information about bus stops can be found in the *PL.PZGiK.332.1801__OT_OIKM_P.xml* file, where they have the *OIKM04* value in the `x_kod` attribute.

```{r}
bus_stop = read_sf("data/PL.PZGiK.332.1801/BDOT10k/PL.PZGiK.332.1801__OT_OIKM_P.xml")
bus_stop = bus_stop[bus_stop$x_kod == "OIKM04", ]
```

Let's prepare a visualization in which the bus stops is marked with blue dots and the buildings are presented as red polygons.

```{r busstops}
plot(st_geometry(communes), main = "Bus stops")
plot(st_geometry(buildings), add = TRUE, border = "red")
plot(st_geometry(bus_stop), add = TRUE, pch = 21, cex = 0.7, col = "blue")
```

Let's create a buffer for each bus stop with a range of 1 km using `st_buffer()`.

```{r}
bus_buffer = st_buffer(bus_stop, 1000)
```

Now, we can plot it all.

```{r buffers}
plot(st_geometry(communes), main = "Bus stops buffers")
plot(st_geometry(buildings), add = TRUE, border = "red")
plot(st_geometry(bus_buffer), add = TRUE)
```

To return the buildings within the buffer range, we can perform the `st_within()` operation.

```{r}
buildings_buffer = st_within(buildings, bus_buffer)
```

The result is a nested list that consists of 2828 buildings and their associated buffers.
Let's count how many buildings are not in any buffer - function `sapply()` is useful for operations on lists.

```{r}
buildings_ex = sapply(buildings_buffer, length)
buildings_ex = sum(buildings_ex == 0)
buildings_ex = round(buildings_ex / nrow(buildings) * 100)
buildings_ex
```

14% of the buildings in this county do not have access to a bus stop within 1 km radius.

```{r include=FALSE}
unlink("data", recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```
