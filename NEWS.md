# rgugik 0.4.0

* The `ortho_request()` and `DEM_request()` functions have been updated
to the new API version. Now you can download the latest orthophotomaps
and DEM products.

* Due to the lack of information about SHA in the database, the `checkSHA`
argument in the `tile_download()` function has been deprecated.
